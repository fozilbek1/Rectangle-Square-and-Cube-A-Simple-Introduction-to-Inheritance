# Rectangle-Square-and-Cube-A-Simple-Introduction-to-Inheritance
This Python project offers a beginner-friendly exploration of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It demonstrates inheritance through three classes: Rectangle, Square, and Cube. Each class inherits properties and behaviors from the previous one, providing a straightforward way to understand how OOP works.

Features:
- Learn about inheritance in Python.
- See practical examples with Rectangle, Square, and Cube classes.
- Understand how to calculate the area of a square and the volume of a cube using inherited methods.
